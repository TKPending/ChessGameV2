# **♟️ Chess Game**

This is a **local multiplayer chess game**, built using **React** and **TypeScript**. Play a simple game of chess against a friend or family member directly in the browser.

The game emphasises clean logic, simple design, and scalability for future improvements.

## **🚀 Tech Stack**

- **React**: Used for building the interactive chess interface in the browser.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing, better tooling, and increased reliability compared to plain JavaScript.
- **Redux**: Manages the game state (board positions, turns, move history), ensuring predictable and maintainable logic.

---

## **🎯 Purpose**

I created this project as a way to **improve my web development skills** while applying concepts of state management and type safety.

I had previously built a version of chess in pure JavaScript, but as my programming skills grew, I decided to rebuild it with TypeScript. This helped me get more comfortable with **typing, code structure, and scalability** in real-world projects.

This project combines my interest in games with my focus on **clean, maintainable frontend code**.

## **🛠️ Features**

- Local multiplayer chess (two players on the same browser)
- Full chess rules and movement logic implemented
- Simple and intuitive UI for smooth gameplay
- State management powered by Redux for consistency

## **🌱 Future Development**

Planned improvements include:

- **⏱ Timer**: Adding chess clocks for Blitz, Rapid, and Classical play.
- **🎨 Design Update**: Revisiting the UI to enhance visual polish and responsiveness.
- **📜 Move History**: Allowing players to view previous moves and rewind the board state.

## **🧑‍💻 About the Developer**

I enjoy building interactive, logic-driven projects that challenge both my problem-solving and design skills. Recreating chess in React + TypeScript gave me the chance to **apply best practices in modern frontend development** while working on something fun and technically engaging.
